# HB9IIU ISS Life Tracker
### **Efficient Real-Time Calculations on an ESP32**

This project is an **ESP32-based tracking system for the International Space Station (ISS)** that demonstrates the impressive functionality and versatility of this microcontroller. Unlike other applications that rely on external APIs to fetch the ISS's current position, this system retrieves only the **Two-Line Elements (TLEs)** and current time from online sources. All orbital calculations are performed in real time using the **SGDP4 library**, making the solution self-contained and dynamic.

The system provides detailed information about ISS passes, including **Acquisition of Signal (AOS)**, **Time of Closest Approach (TCA)**, and **Loss of Signal (LOS)**. The data is displayed on a **480x320 TFT screen** with a touchscreen interface, offering **clear and informative visualizations** such as polar plots, azimuth/elevation graphs, and satellite footprint maps. 

This project highlights how much capability can be packed into an ESP32, handling computationally intensive tasks while remaining compact and efficient.

  A lightweight and efficient JSON library for parsing and generating JSON data, commonly used with web APIs.

- **`Sgp4.h`**  
  Implements the Simplified General Perturbations Model 4 (SGP4) for satellite orbit calculations, critical for tracking objects like the ISS.

- **`NTPClient.h`**  
  A simple Network Time Protocol (NTP) client for synchronizing the ESP32's internal clock with an NTP server.

- **`WiFiUdp.h`**  
  Provides UDP communication capabilities, used in conjunction with protocols like NTP.

### Note
All the required libraries are already included in the repository‚Äôs `lib` folder. **There is no need to install additional libraries**‚Äîthis ensures that the project compiles and runs seamlessly.

## Hardware Assembly

- You will find the wiring diagram in the `doc` folder of this repository.
- The assembly process is straightforward: you simply need to wire specific pins of the ESP32 to the TFT display as shown in the diagram.
- There is **no need for a custom PCB**. The connections have been made pin-to-pin directly.
- To simplify the soldering process, you can use **Dupont cables** with their plastic housings removed. This makes handling and soldering much easier.
## 3D Printing

To enhance the usability and aesthetics of the project, I have included **all necessary STL files** for 3D printing in the `doc` folder of this repository. These files allow you to print the enclosure for your hardware, ensuring a neat and organized setup.

## Setup

1. **Copy the Repository**:  
   Download the project files from the repository:  
   [https://github.com/HB9IIU/ESP32-ISS-Tracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/HB9IIU/ESP32-ISS-Tracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. **Install PlatformIO**:  
   PlatformIO is the development environment used to compile and upload the code to the ESP32. Follow these steps to install it:  

   - **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:  
     Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

   - **Install the PlatformIO IDE Extension**:  
     1. Open VS Code.  
     2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.  
     3. Search for "**PlatformIO IDE**" and click "**Install**".  

   - **Verify Installation**:  
     1. Restart VS Code after installation.  
     2. Access PlatformIO by clicking on its icon (a small alien head) in the sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+P`.

3. **Open the Project Folder**:  
   - Unzip the downloaded repository.  
   - Open VS Code.  
   - Click on **File > Open Folder**, then select the unzipped project folder.  
   - Wait for PlatformIO to automatically download all necessary dependencies (this may take a few minutes).

4. **Configure `config.h`**:  
   Update the following parameters in the `config.h` file to match your Wi-Fi and location:  
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "your-ssid"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-password"
   #define OBSERVER_LATITUDE 46.4717
   #define OBSERVER_LONGITUDE 6.8768
   #define OBSERVER_ALTITUDE 400
   ```

5. **Compile and Upload the Code**:  
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.  
   - In VS Code, open the **PlatformIO toolbar** (left sidebar).  
   - Click on the **"Build"** button (checkmark icon) to compile the code.  
     - If the compilation succeeds, proceed to the next step.  
   - Click on the **"Upload"** button (arrow icon) to upload the code to your ESP32.

6. **Run the Tracker**:  
   Once the code is uploaded successfully:  
   - The TFT screen will display a splash image.  
   - The ESP32 will connect to Wi-Fi and start retrieving ISS tracking data.  
   - The screen will update with real-time information about the ISS.

## How It Works

1. **Retrieve TLE Data**: The tracker fetches Two-Line Element (TLE) data for the ISS from online APIs.
2. **Predict Satellite Passes**: Using the **Sgp4** library, it calculates upcoming passes for the observer's location.
3. **Render Visualizations**: The TFT display shows live satellite data, including passes, azimuth, elevation, and more.
