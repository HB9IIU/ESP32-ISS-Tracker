### **Efficient Real-Time Calculations on an ESP32**


This project is an **ESP32-based tracking system for the International Space Station (ISS)** that demonstrates the impressive functionality and versatility of this microcontroller. Unlike other applications that rely on external APIs to fetch the ISS's current position, this system retrieves only the **Two-Line Elements (TLEs)** and current time from online sources. All orbital calculations are performed in real time using the **SGDP4 library**, making the solution self-contained and dynamic.

The system provides detailed information about ISS passes, including **Acquisition of Signal (AOS)**, **Time of Closest Approach (TCA)**, and **Loss of Signal (LOS)**. The data is displayed on a **480x320 TFT screen** with a touchscreen interface, offering **clear and informative visualizations** such as polar plots, azimuth/elevation graphs, and satellite footprint maps. 

This project highlights how much capability can be packed into an ESP32, handling computationally intensive tasks while remaining compact and efficient.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ISS-Life-Tracker.git
   cd ISS-Life-Tracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure the necessary libraries are installed in your IDE.

3. **Configure `config.h`**:
   Update the following parameters:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "your-ssid"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-password"
   #define OBSERVER_LATITUDE 46.4717
   #define OBSERVER_LONGITUDE 6.8768
   #define OBSERVER_ALTITUDE 400
   ```

4. **Upload to ESP32**:
   - Connect the ESP32 to your computer.
   - Compile and upload the code using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

5. **Run the Tracker**:
   The TFT screen will display a splash image, connect to Wi-Fi, and start retrieving and displaying ISS tracking data.

## How It Works

1. **Retrieve TLE Data**: The tracker fetches Two-Line Element (TLE) data for the ISS from online APIs.
2. **Predict Satellite Passes**: Using the **Sgp4** library, it calculates upcoming passes for the observer's location.
3. **Render Visualizations**: The TFT display shows live satellite data, including passes, azimuth, elevation, and more.
